# Green-Stock-Analysis
## Background

Steve is a huge fan of the workbook I made for him. He has the ability to analyze a whole dataset with a single button click. He now wants to enlarge the dataset to encompass the entire stock market over the last five years in order to conduct some additional study for his parents. My code might not perform as well for thousands of stocks even while it functions fine for a dozen equities. And if it does, the execution phase might be prolonged.
To gather the same data that I did in this module, I will modify, or remodel, the Module 2 solution code to cycle through all the data once in this challenge. Next, I'll assess if the VBA script executed more quickly as a result of my code reworking efforts.

## Purpose
In this project and analyisis, we’ll edit, or refactor, the Stock Market Dataset with VBA solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect an entire dataser. Then, we’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, we just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor existing VBA code to improve its efficiency and execution time. The initial code was designed to analyze a limited dataset of stocks, but now the goal is to expand it to cover the entire stock market over the past few years. By looping through the data once and collecting the required information, we aim to enhance the code's performance, specifically when dealing with a larger number of stocks. You can find the Excel bookwork for responding to macros in the following

## Results
The result of this project was a macro that contained information about tickdfs and the returm of tickers in 2017 and 2018.

## Summary 
### Results
- With these Macros created we can clearly see the table with analysis for each year.
- Steve can read the table lot easier due to conditional formatting.
- Updated Macro's can be used to run the analysis for any year.
- We refactored the codes to run faster in VBA so that if Steve has a larger dataset he can analyze it quickly.

### Advanatages of Refactoring codes.
- Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. It just makes the code more efficient with fewer steps.
- Refactoring codes help reduce the run time of the Macros.
- It looks much cleaner and helps the future user to understand and read it better.

### Disadvanatages of Refactoring codes.
- Refactoring codes can be time-consuming.
- It might be difficult for larger and more complicated codes to refactor.
- It may sometimes alter the outcomes.
